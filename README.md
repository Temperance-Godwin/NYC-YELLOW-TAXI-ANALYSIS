## INTRODUCTION
In todayâ€™s competitive ride-hailing landscape, leveraging data to boost operational efficiency and revenue has become increasingly important. Taxi services, especially in bustling cities like New York, must continuously explore strategies that enhance driver income while preserving a smooth and satisfying experience for passengers. One often overlooked yet potentially impactful factor is the method of payment used by customers. Understanding how payment choices affect fare values and customer behaviors could help taxi operators make informed decisions that benefit both drivers and riders. This study dives into the dynamics between payment types and fare amounts, aiming to uncover actionable insights through data analysis and hypothesis testing.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the competitive world of taxi bookings, increasing revenue is crucial for both long-term sustainability and driver satisfaction. This project seeks to leverage data-driven strategies to optimize earnings for taxi drivers. Specifically, we investigate whether the method of payment influences the fare amount, focusing on the potential link between payment type and total fare.
## RESEARCH QUESTION
1. Is there a significant relationship between the total fare paid and the type of payment used?
2. Can customer behavior be influenced to prefer higher-revenue payment options without reducing customer satisfaction?
## OBJECTIVE
The primary aim of this project is to conduct an A/B test to assess whether there's a meaningful difference in fare amounts based on the customer's payment method. By using Python for statistical hypothesis testing and descriptive analytics, we aim to uncover trends that can help drivers optimize their income. Specifically, the focus is on comparing credit card payments to cash payments to determine if one consistently results in higher fares.
## DATA SOURCE

## DATA OVERVIEW
This analysis draws on a robust dataset from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, containing detailed records of taxi trips. After applying data cleaning techniques and performing feature engineering, we isolated the essential variables needed for this investigation, including fare amount, payment type, trip duration, and passenger count.

## METHODOLOGY
**Descriptive Statistics:** Used to summarize and visualize key variables such as fare amount and payment method distribution.

**Hypothesis Testing:** A two-sample T-test was conducted to assess if there's a statistically significant difference in fare amounts between payment types.

**Regression Analysis:** Applied linear regression to examine the correlation between trip duration (derived from pickup and drop-off times) and fare amount.
